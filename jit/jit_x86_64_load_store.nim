#               Notes on lower than 32-bit loads
#
# ############################################################

#  Regarding 16-bit loads
#    - It only saves one byte as we would need the 0x66 16-bit mode prefix
#    - Partial register loads cause stalls (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573502/why-doesnt-gcc-use-partial-registers)
#      because 8 and 16-bit immediate are not zero-extended into the register
#      so the CPU must assume dependency with the underlying larger register.
#      There is no penalties for loading 32-bit immediate into a 64-bit registers,
#      those are always zero-extended
#
#  Regarding 8-bit loads:
#    - Only speific registers are available.
#    - While it does not need an extra prefix as there are dedicated opcodes
#      it still suffers from partial register load stalls.
